# Berserk5
This repo contains a game I wrote a while back in Python using John Zelle's `graphics.py` library (a verbatim copy of his library is provided with my source code as per the terms of the GPL, under which this repo is also licensed, and as `berserk5.py` depends on it). This repo also contains a macOS executable of the game, `berserk5`.

This game is best played with a trackpad. At each level, you have 10 seconds to tap or click the circle as many times as is specified in the upper right corner. There are 20 levels, and the circle will move faster and more randomly with each level. In normal mode, you must click the circle 10 times each level, but in berserk mode the number of times to click the circle will increase, and the radius of the circle will decrease, with each level. The circle will move faster and more randomly in berserk mode as well.

I will warn anyone who tries to read the source file that there are no comments and only poorly named variables. Still, the game is quite fun.
